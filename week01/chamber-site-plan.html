      <p>
        <strong>Persona 1:</strong> Gayle fits in the stereotypical PNW box. She
        is single and in her 30s. She loves to hike, travel, and go thrift
        shopping. She is all about being eco friendly and ops to buy organic
        products when available. She has a mid-size dog who she treats like her
        child and takes almost everywhere with her. Hiking on the weekends is
        always expected, and she’s trying to grow her social media following by
        posting hiking pictures all the time. She works for an organic farming
        company as their social media manager but doesn’t make a lot of money.
        She ties to wear/use high quality clothing/gear but it’s typically
        bought second hand. Gayle is looking for cute towns to visit where she
        can take her dog, go hiking, and enjoy an afternoon of shopping and
        eating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Persona 2:</strong> Faustus is in his mid 20’s and just got a
        job working for a start up tech company in nearby Salem. He plans to
        spend a lot of time working, but when he’s off, he wants to be able to
        relax in a smaller hometown. He is newly married, and his wife is a
        nurse. They want to start having children soon but are concerned about
        the school and town where they should locate to. Faustus loves to watch
        the college football games and go hunting in his spare time. Faustus is
        looking to settle down and needs to be able to research a town before
        making the decision to move.
