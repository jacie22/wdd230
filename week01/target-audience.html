                <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <p><strong>Persona 1:</strong> Gayle fits in the stereotypical PNW box. She is single and in her 30s. She loves to hike, travel, and go thrift shopping. She is all about being eco friendly and ops to buy organic products when available. She has a mid-size dog who she treats like her child and takes almost everywhere with her. Hiking on the weekends is always expected, and she’s trying to grow her social media following by posting hiking pictures all the time. She works for an organic farming company as their social media manager but doesn’t make a lot of money. She ties to wear/use high quality clothing/gear but it’s typically bought second hand. Gayle is looking for cute towns to visit where she can take her dog, go hiking, and enjoy an afternoon of shopping and eating.</p>   
                    <p><strong>Persona 2:</strong> Faustus is in his mid 20’s and just got a job working for a start up tech company in nearby Salem. He plans to spend a lot of time working, but when he’s off, he wants to be able to relax in a smaller hometown. He is newly married, and his wife is a nurse. They want to start having children soon but are concerned about the school and town where they should locate to. Faustus loves to watch the college football games and go hunting in his spare time. Faustus is looking to settle down and needs to be able to research a town before making the decision to move. </p>
